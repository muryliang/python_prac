msgid "What?! They're taking my fish?!"

msgid "The reign of the Snow King is over!"
msgstr ""

msgid "What are you talking about? His reign has only just begun!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yeah, and now it's going to end! He should have thought about that "
"before taking away MY fish!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Fish?! I will not allow you to overthrow the great king over a tax! Your "
"conquest ends here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Who are you?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I am Tux, and I am putting an end to the Snow King's reign, one castle at "
"a time!"
msgstr ""

msgid "That's too bad, Tux. I would have liked to let you leave in peace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So it is you! The rebellious penguin who would see to it that our king's "
"reign ends!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I'm sorry to inform you, Tux, but your treason ends now."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I don't know how you found out about our secret plans, but you will not "
"stop us!"
msgstr ""

msgid "I've been waiting for you, Tux. We meet again at last!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Raccot the yeti! I should have known it was you!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may have discovered my evil plan, my old nemesis, but you will not "

"Citizens of Icy Island,\n"
"\n"
"Beginning on Ice-date 542-7-3, Icy Island is now the domain of the Snow "

"Fire can be a great way to melt ice blocking access to certain Tux dolls. "
"Now, where can one find a fire flower around here?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Traveler's Note:\n"
"\n"
"I swear, there are no fire flowers anywhere in this level! How am I "
"supposed to melt this ice?! What's more, that ledge over there is shaped "
"like a grin, almost like it's taunting me!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Studies have shown that penguins have the ability to kick iceblocks, and "
"possibly other items, straight up. They do this by holding down the \"up\" "

"Traveler's Note:\n"

"It is said that this level contains 7 springs, but I have only managed to "

"\"down\" button while pressing the \"action\" button."

"That pipe to the right is too high to be reached even by jumping off a "
"spring. It would be possible if that Jumpy could be magically suspended in "
"the air and the spring placed on top, but that would be silly!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You'll need a friend to find the Tux doll in this castle, in more ways "
"than one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please do NOT touch my rocks! For example, do NOT use them to build a "
"bridge allowing you to cross spike pits, and do NOT use them to build a "
"tower so that you can reach higher places."
